</h3>
                        <p>This season, the BullBots had to create a robot that could intake and place both cones AND
cubes onto shelves called the "grid." Thus, Rafiki was born with a versatile wheeled intake and
grabbing arm mechanism that worked for both game pieces. Rafiki was also our first competition
bot with a swerve drivetrain, which was a lot of fun to see running at both the Ventura County
and Idaho Regional!</p>

</h3>
                        <p>This season was full of excitement, and Clampy's swift and effective climbing mechanism
carried us straight to the finals at the Idaho regional. Rapid React presented a new challenge of
climbing not one, but four gradually higher rungs to reach the traversal, and Clampy did just
that! We also were able to score this year’s game piece ("oversized tennis balls") in both
possible scoring locations.</p>

                        <p>Despite the global pandemic that shut the world down, the robotics efforts still continued with
our previous season’s robot Walter. We competed in several at home challenges, and in
September, Walter had another chance to compete in-person at the Idaho Invitational
off-season event. We took home two Quality Awards and learned a lot despite the
circumstances.</p>

It has bright blue and green LED's and speakers for style points. Also, it is extremely fun to shoot empty Gatorade bottles.</p>

</h3>
                        <p>Skybound excels in collecting gears and running them to the airship. Skybound also has a special climber that can latch onto any rope. It features a saw-blade on a mini-sim motor, which allows the robot to climb, but prevents the robot from slipping off the rope. The saw-blade mechanism that Skybound used to climb the rope won the Creativity award. Skybound is one of our smaller robots, weighing in at only 86 lbs. Skybound is happily active and frequently used for demos.</p>
