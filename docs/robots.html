                        <h3>Rafiki</h3>
                        <p>This season, the BullBots had to create a robot that could intake and place both cones AND cubes onto shelves called the "grid." Thus, Rafiki was born with a versatile wheeled intake and grabbing arm mechanism that worked for both game pieces. Rafiki was also our first competition bot with a swerve drivetrain, which was a lot of fun to see running at both the Ventura County and Idaho Regional!</p>

                        <p>This season was full of excitement, and Clampy's swift and effective climbing mechanism carried us straight to the finals at the Idaho regional. Rapid React presented a new challenge of climbing not one, but four gradually higher rungs to reach the traversal, and Clampy did just that! We also were able to score this year’s game piece ("oversized tennis balls") in both possible scoring locations.</p>

                        <p>Despite the global pandemic that shut the world down, the robotics efforts still continued with our previous season’s robot Walter. We competed in several at home challenges, and in September, Walter had another chance to compete in-person at the Idaho Invitational off-season event. We took home two Quality Awards and learned a lot despite the circumstances.</p>

                        <p>2020 presented a new challenge where bots had to shoot dodgeball-sized cargo into a precise target for full points. The BullBots made Walter with a full Omni wheel intake system and a variable shooter that could shoot cargo from multiple heights.</p>

It has bright blue and green LED's and speakers for style points. Also, it is extremely fun to shoot empty Gatorade bottles.</p>

                        <h3>Skybound</h3>
                        <p>Skybound excels in collecting gears and running them to the airship. Skybound also has a special climber that can latch onto any rope. It features a saw-blade on a mini-sim motor, which allows the robot to climb, but prevents the robot from slipping off the rope. The saw-blade mechanism that Skybound used to climb the rope won the Creativity award. Skybound is one of our smaller robots, weighing in at only 86 lbs. Skybound is happily active and frequently used for demos.</p>

                        <p>Minotaur had a tank drive with a set of 10 wheels. It was able to easily climb over rocky surfaces and was quick at shooting boulders into the top of the tower. Minotaur gained a representation as a brute and "John Cena" as it ran a team member over as a prototype. Minotaur used pneumatics to push the boulder to the end of the shoot where wheels moved upwards to aim higher. The intake of boulders used the same parts as the shooter, moving downwards and reversing the intake.</p>

                        <p>Valkyrie is a champion among our bots. One of few robots that was able to climb up to the third tier on the Ultimate Ascent pyramid. It used a piston arm to latch onto the top tier and then used the same piston to climb. Valkyrie reached Rank 7, with a record of 11-5-0. It won the Regional Finalists Award as well as the Industrial Design Award sponsored by General Motors.</p>
