# Welcome to Bullbots’s Team 1891!
The Bullbots are the first established team in the Treasure Valley/Boise, ID. We have helped branch out to many other students to create neighboring teams. We started in 2006 with the help of Micron and other sponsors. We have sought to promote FIRST values and invite more students to participate in FIRST. We have attended the local BSU Stem Day to promote our team, FIRST, and interest in STEM. Other community involvements vary from Demonstrations, Large Service Programs and First Lego League Camps. We hope to encourage more STEM interest and community growth through our efforts.

## Building Our Robots
Each year the FIRST Robotics Competition kicks off on the first Saturday of January. Students from all around the world gather to watch the live stream revealing the official game. After the kickoff, teams set out to create a robot that will complete different tasks around the field. Over the course of the next six weeks, students will be guided by mentors in building, wiring and programming a robot to beat out the competition.

FIRST Robotics Competition challenges students to think outside the box and create amazing inventions. FIRST is more than robots, the competition hosts thousands of students with the same interests, bringing them together.

## Charged Up 2023
Two alliances must compete against each other to bring energy to their community. For alliances to bring energy they can retrieve and score cones and/or cubes to the grid, and dock onto their charge station. The first 15 seconds, alliance robots may do this autonomously to receive extra points. The last 30 seconds of the match the robots race to dock or engage with their charge station. The alliance with the highest score at the end of the match wins.
