Stronghold
Minotaur
Minotaur had a tank drive with a set of 10 wheels. It was able to easily climb over rocky surfaces and was quick at shooting boulders into the top of the tower. Minotaur gained a representation as a brute and "John Cena" as it ran a team member over as a prototype. Minotaur used pneumatics to push the boulder to the end of the shoot where wheels moved upwards to aim higher. The intake of boulders used the same parts as the shooter, moving downwards and reversing the intake.
