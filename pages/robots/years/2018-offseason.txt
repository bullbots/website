Amaterasu
Amaterasu has been the dream of the team since the beginning. Before our 2018 Season began, we built Amaterasu to encourage more young engineers to join the Bullbots. It has bright blue and green LED's and speakers for style points. Also, it is extremely fun to shoot empty Gatorade bottles.
