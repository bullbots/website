Infinite Recharge - At Home challenge
Walter 2.0
Despite the global pandemic that shut the world down, the robotics efforts still continued with
our previous seasonâ€™s robot Walter. We competed in several at home challenges, and in
September, Walter had another chance to compete in-person at the Idaho Invitational
off-season event. We took home two Quality Awards and learned a lot despite the
circumstances.
