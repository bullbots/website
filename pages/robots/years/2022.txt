Rapid React
Clampy
This season was full of excitement, and Clampy's swift and effective climbing mechanism
carried us straight to the finals at the Idaho regional. Rapid React presented a new challenge of
climbing not one, but four gradually higher rungs to reach the traversal, and Clampy did just
that! We also were able to score this yearâ€™s game piece ("oversized tennis balls") in both
possible scoring locations.
