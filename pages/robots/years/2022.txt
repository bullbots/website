Rapid React
Clampy
This season was full of excitement, and Clampy's swift and effective climbing mechanism carried us straight to the finals at the Idaho regional. Rapid React presented a new challenge of climbing not one, but four gradually higher rungs to reach the traversal, and Clampy did just that! We also were able to score this year’s game piece ("oversized tennis balls") in both possible scoring locations.
