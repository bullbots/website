Rafiki
This season, the BullBots had to create a robot that could intake and place both cones AND cubes onto shelves called the "grid." Thus, Rafiki was born with a versatile wheeled intake and grabbing arm mechanism that worked for both game pieces. Rafiki was also our first competition bot with a swerve drivetrain, which was a lot of fun to see running at both the Ventura County and Idaho Regional!
