# Summer Camps

### What Do the Campers Do?

Each year the Bullbots host a couple of week long summer camps for kids ages 9-13.  Throughout the week the campers learn how to complete challenges using a LEGO Mindstorm EV3 Robot.  As the camp progresses campers learn how to use and program different sensors to complete different tasks.  We like finish the week off with a friendly competition with Sumo Bots.
